More than half a century ago, the U.S. used provocative posters and fake news to influence its soldiers, its citizens, and even its enemies. The United States was about six months into World War II when it founded the Office of War Information (OWI). Its mission: to disseminate political propaganda. The office spread its messages through print, radio, and film—but perhaps its most striking legacy is its posters.

Hi, my beloved truelesbians. Following an idea sparked by a comment from u/vistarmonei, I decided to put together a list of lesbian related films. A Lesbian Movie Database of sorts, or LMDB, if you will. :) I've listed the films alphabetically and included a link to the IMDB entry for each. I've tried to keep the blurbs spoiler-free. Some of these films have only marginal connections to lesbians, like _Mulholland Drive_, but I felt they should be included. In some cases, the characters could.

The fictions covers themselves being a bright canary yellow, signifying the contents within its pages.

True Giallo film debuting I'd say MAYBE Witness (1985), Peter Weir's movie about an Amish community and a group of criminals who are trying to cover up a murder. I'm not sure this film qualifies because it's often brought up during discussions about which Harrison Ford performance is his best one. But I don't see it discussed online that often. It also seems like the type of movie that Witness represents is pretty much extinct. I'm not even sure you could find a film like this in the art house circuit. Or among. Not sure who would have the attention span to read all this but at the least, I felt like listing out what I saw this year. All the stuff I have seen before from start to finish has an asterisk by it.

I've done it. Not only have I reached my goal for the volume of horror I've watched this month, but I also set a goal for myself to try and watch a lot of horror I'd never seen before, or wouldn't normally go out for. Shudder has made that easier for me. In fact, I've really enjoyed being able to find some random movie on Shudder that I may never have even heard of, and just put it on without thinking about it.

It's actually an even worse situation now as the top boxoffice films are rarely nominated for Best Pictu. 
The Argyle family is far from pleased to discover one of its number has been posthumously pardoned for murder – if Jacko Argyle didn’t kill his mother, who did? Dr. Arthur Calgary takes a ferry across the Rubicon River to Sunny Point, the home of the Argyle family.
