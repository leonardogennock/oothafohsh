                            <p> So many years ago at band practice I needed a few extra chords. One of my band mates told me that he had a crate full of them I could have. I said sure why not. Well he went home for a few and came back with a huge crate of chords. I picked out the cables I needed at the time and jammed till we were spent. Well after practice I was looking through the box seeing what it contained. Welllll, at the very bottom I saw a few pedals. A BOSS OC-2 octave pedal, a Ross Flanger and a BOSS PW-2 Powerdriv. I have 2 ODs and 2 distortions on my board. They are all right in a row, and all are attached to a true bypass looper. At this time, I only ever use one at a time. I hear about players using multiple dirt pedals at a time, but whenever I try to do so, all I get is a mess. So, I am curious. Who here uses multiple dirt pedals at the same time? Good results? What are the plusses and minuses? What are the tricks to making this work? Etc. Would love an education. If it matters, my OD/dist.

To the credit of Cosmic Fire, many of these votes highlighted was a difficult decision this was. Quality. I figured I'd run through my rig and past pedals and my experience with them. This is moreso for when someone uses the search bar in hopes of finding some opinions and post-honeymoon reviews of pedals before they buy them. Order is the order I got them in. Bolded pedals are pedals I still have.If you've got any questions about my experience with any of these pedals just holler! Boss DD-3 - My first pedal. Honestly, not my favourite. I could never dial in anything I enjoyed, but then again. 
# Preface With the continuing popularity of the Astrolux S41, an updated was developed: The S42. This light is essentially iterative, but adds micro-USB charging. And the Nichia emitter (which I have here) is 219c instead of 219b. Possibly most importantly, a new user interface! Let’s see how this S42 stacks up! And yes, this is my second review today. I've been sitting on this one for a while, waiting on some spare parts.

It's a Dell tower that my company bought for (what they thought would be) their newly hired "Creative Director". The dude worked for a week and on the Monday of the second week he decided he would make his own work schedule without going through the proper channels. Tuesday rolls around, he's not at the office, and as expected this didn't jive well with my boss man so he fired the guy. IT guy comes into our department and starts.
